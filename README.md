* 🧭 **Golden Data Platform Strategy**

🧠 **My expertise spans**:

* Data & Analytics Strategy
* Data Product Management
* Data Governance
* Analytics & Data Engineering
* Machine Learning Engineering


## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Tools:

* **Cloud & Storage**: Amazon S3
* **Data Engineering & Analytics**: dbt, Databricks, Spark (Scala), Python
* **Databases**: Redshift, Snowflake, Oracle, SQL Server
* **Visualization & BI**: Power BI, Looker, OBIEE
